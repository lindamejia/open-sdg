Breaking changes:

* Translation keys for indicators/targets are now expected to be dash-delimited instead of dot-delimited. This means that you should **not** upgrade to this release until you are using SDG Translations [0.6.0](https://github.com/open-sdg/sdg-translations/releases/tag/0.6.0) or higher.
* Data disaggregation translation keys (ie, translations inside a `data.yml` file) are now expected to be case-sensitive matches, and are no longer automatically converted to lowercase.
